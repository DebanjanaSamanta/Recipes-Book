Recipe
Combine dry ingredients. Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Set aside.
Cream, butter, and sugar. In a large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment to cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until incorporated. 
Prepare wet ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together vanilla, yogurt, and water. Set aside.
Combine ingredients. Add one-third of the dry ingredients to the butter-egg mixture and beat until just combined. Then, add half of the yogurt mixture, and beat until combined. Repeat until you end with the dry ingredients. Scrape down the bowl as needed and beat until just combined and smooth. Do not overmix. The batter will be thick.
Divide the batter. Use a medium cookie scoop to scoop up the batter and divide it into a 12-tin muffin pan lined with cupcake liners, filling the liners â…” full with batter.
Bake. Bake in a 350 F preheated oven for 18-20 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcake comes out clean.
Cool. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the muffin pan for 5 minutes, then transfer into a wire cooling rack to cool completely before icing.
Finally, add milk and beat until light and fluffy. Add more milk if the buttercream is too thick; add more confectioners' sugar if the buttercream is too thin. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth until you are ready to use the icing to prevent it from drying out.

Use couplers to secure a no. 2D decorating tip onto a piping bag to frost the cupcakes. Fill the bag with icing and pipe the icing onto each cupcake starting at the edges and move in an overlapping circular motion until you reach the center and gently lift. Add chocolate sprinkles on top, if desired.
